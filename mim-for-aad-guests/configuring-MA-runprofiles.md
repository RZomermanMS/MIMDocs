- [MIM Synchronization Service](install-mim-sync-service.md)
- [The MIM synchronization MA](installing-MimMa.md) 
- [The Active Directory MA](installing-ADMA.md)

For each of the three created MAâ€™s

## Next: Configuring Synchronization Rules in the MIM Portal 
A number of rules will have to be created through the MIM portal, this includes importing users from AAD and AD and exporting users to AD:
- [Synchronization Rule 1: Import Guest User from Azure Active Directory](rule1-import-from-aad.md)
- [Synchronization Rule 2: Import Active Directory Guest users](rule2-import-from-ad.md)
- [Synchronization Rule 3: Create Guest User account in Active Directory](rule3-export-to-ad.md)
